# XBeachToolkit
# The files for the hands-on exercise on 7/15/2025 are located in the "CEDS DEMO - Copy" folder.
# Inside are a variety of scripts. The ones in the folder labeled "OET" SHOULD NOT be modified. The other scripts rely on them for additional functions.
# The primary script you will be using is batch_transect_empty.m, which is formatted for the user to set up and run simulations relatively quickly. 
# Everything that needs an input in that script is labeled. The complete version is labeled batch_transect_complete.m, in case an example is needed.

# The XBeach Workflow Walkthrough document is designed to take the user through the entire process, from setup in AutoCAD and ArcGIS through running the simulation. 
# The exercise itself will only cover the portion of the workflow involving Matlab, as it is the most complicated.
# The QUICKPLOT software is located in "CEDS DEMO - Copy\QUICKPLOT\bin\d3d.qp" 
# Double-click it to start. It will take a little while. The dropdown menu will allow selection of results from finished XBeach simulations.
